# Roomex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Starting the project

After clonging the repository just run the following commands:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start`

## The choices I made :)

First of all thank you for taking your time to evaluate my assignment, I just wanted to make clear about some of my choices!

1. I have used Material as a Ui Kit to make things look better and possibly work smoother than native inputs.
2. I have started testing the `enter` component, althought I could expand on the testing, I believe that the scope of this assignment wasn't to see how far I can go on testing.
3. I chose to use the standalone project structure because I really find it easier to use and to develop with (honestly one of the feature I have most liked about Angular 16).
4. I haven't spent a lot of time making things look perfect, and I have tried to be more focused on the application itself, rather than the app aesthetic. (Ex. I have not used the media query to have a better UI, but if we expand on the style part of the project I'll gladly adjust everything).
